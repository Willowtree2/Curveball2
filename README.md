# Curveball
This GitHub repository contains code to reproduce the results presented in ['Proof of uniform sampling of binary matrices with fixed row sums and column sums for the fast Curveball algorithm'](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.042812). 

In particular it contains an implementation of the original Curveball algorithm (see ['A fast and unbiased procedure to randomize ecological binary matrices with fixed row and column totals'](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140611/ncomms5114/abs/ncomms5114.html)) and the Good Shuffle algorithm. Furthermore, it contains implementations of the Simple Curveball algorithm, the Simple Undirected Curveball algorithm and two additional Curveball style algorithms that will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.
