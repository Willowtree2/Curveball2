# Curveball

This repository contains an implementation of the Curveball algorithm as defined in 
['A fast and unbiased procedure to randomize ecological binary matrices with fixed row and column totals'](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140611/ncomms5114/abs/ncomms5114.html). 

It also contains the implementation of the Good-Shuffle Curveball algorithm as defined in a forthcoming publication. 

More code coming soon!
